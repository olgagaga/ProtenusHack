Protenus Hackathon Model - Sales Forecasting

Data cleaning, filling NA values, one-hot encoding & label-encoding of categorical features. Performed feature engineering: incorporated cannabis legalization data, salary data and some business-related features. Performed scaling of numerical columns. Used XGBoost regressor to forecast annual opportunity amount. To forecast Q3 sales, we had to predict ClosedDown oppotrunitites. This part is to develop in the future.
